## Reinforcement Learning Projects
### 1. Reinforcement Learning algorithm applied to an Atari Game
#### File: Breakout_Atari_RL
  [ ] Importing an ensuring Atari game works<br/>
  [ ] Apply a policy to the game and train an RL model to play the game<br/>
  
### 2. Reinforcement Learning algorithm (PPO) applied to the cartpole game
#### File: Cartpole_RL
  [✔] Importing Cartpole Game using OpenAi Gym<br/>
  [✔] Apply the PPO (proximal policy optimization) algorithm to train an RL agent to balance the pole<br/>
  
### 3. Q-Learning model from scratch applied to a custom enviroment made from pygame <br/>
#### File: RL_Custom_Env
  [✔] Making the Locations class (to manage a general map)<br/>
  [✔] Making the Environment class (to add terrain, traps and bonuses)<br/>
  [✔] Making the Agent class (to add the agent)<br/>
  [✔] Making the Deque class (to be used in Environment to ensure maze has a path from start to end: using breadth-first search algorithm)<br/>
  [✔] Making the custom environment class for gym<br/>
  [✔] Applying a Q-Learning model/algorithm onto the custom gym environment<br/>
  [✔] Cleanup of presentation and application of Q-learning<br/>
