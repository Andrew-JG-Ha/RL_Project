Reinforcement Learning Projects
1. Reinforcement Learning algorithm applied to an Atari Game

2. Reinforcement Learning algorithm (PPO) applied to the cartpole game
  
3. Q-Learning model from scratch applied to a custom enviroment made from pygame <br/>
  [✔] Making the Locations class (to manage a general map)<br/>
  [✔] Making the Environment class (to add terrain, traps and bonuses)<br/>
  [✔] Making the Agent class (to add the agent)<br/>
  [✔] Making the Deque class (to be used in Environment to ensure maze has a path from start to end: using breadth-first search algorithm)<br/>
  [] Making the custom environment class for gym<br/>
  [] Applying a Q-Learning model/algorithm onto the custom gym environment<br/>
